Would Cup Square

Indore, like every other Indian city, is one that loves cricket. Indoreâ€™s obsession with cricket and everything that is related to cricket knows no bounds, and the biggest proof of this craze is the 35 foot statue of the 2011 World Cup trophy situated in town. The huge statue was made to honor the Indian cricket team and their victory in the 2011 World Cup.
