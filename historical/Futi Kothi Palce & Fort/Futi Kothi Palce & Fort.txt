Futi Kothi Palce & Fort

The building was originally commissioned by Tukojirao Holkar II (1844-1886). It was considered to have been planned by the Holkars to possibly rival the British; they wanted a more elaborate version of the British Residency at Mhow (presently Dr Ambedkar Nagar) in eastern Indore.
